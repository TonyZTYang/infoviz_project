Data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary trees, therefore constitute building blocks that can be reused, extended, and combined in order to make powerful programs. This course teaches how to implement them in a high-level language, how to analyze their effect on algorithm efficiency, and how to modify them to write computer programs that solve complex problems in a most efficient way.

First, the mastering of a modern object-oriented programming language, enough to allow students to tackle real-world problems of important significance. Second, gaining an appreciation of computational thinking, a process that provides the foundations for solving real-world problems. Finally, providing an overview of the very diverse and exciting field of computer science - a field which, arguably more than any other, impacts how we work, live, and play today.\nPrerequisite: Introduction to Computer Programming or placement exam. \nEquivalency: This course counts for CSCI-UA 101.\nFulfillment: Core Curriculum Requirement Algorithmic Thinking; Computer Science Major Required Courses; Computer Systems Engineering Major Required Courses; Data Science Major Foundational Courses; Electrical and Systems Engineering Major Required Major Courses.",

We will apply machine learning to numerical, textual, and image data. Topics will be drawn from perceptron algorithm, regression,  gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, support vector machines, kernels for support vector machines, recommendation systems, decision trees and random forests, maximum likelihood, estimation, logistic regression, neural networks and the back propagation algorithm, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks,  Bayesian analysis and naive Bayes, clustering, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), sentiment analysis, dimensionality reduction and principle component analysis, reinforcement learning.  \n\nPrerequisite:\nFor students following the 2019-20 or later bulletin, Introduction to Computer Programming, Calculus, (Probability and Statistics OR Theory of Probability).\nFor students following the 2018-19 or earlier and are declared data science/computer science majors,  Statistics for Business & Econ can be regarded as an alternative to Probability and Statistics OR Theory of Probability.
